## Release Description

### 🚨 **Critical Hotfix: React 19 Compatibility**

This patch release resolves a critical dependency resolution issue that was preventing package installations and builds when using React 19 with the vaul drawer component.

**Problem Solved**: `npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve` - vaul package was incompatible with React 19.1.0

**Solution**: Updated vaul from v0.9.6 to v1.1.2, which includes full React 19 support in peer dependencies.

### 🔧 **What's Fixed**

#### **Dependency Resolution**
- ✅ **npm install** now works without flags or errors
- ✅ **npm run build** completes successfully (49 seconds)
- ✅ **npm run dev** starts without dependency warnings
- ✅ All ERESOLVE conflicts resolved

#### **Build System**
- ✅ **Production builds** work correctly
- ✅ **11 static pages** generated successfully
- ✅ **Bundle optimization** maintained
- ✅ **TypeScript compilation** error-free

#### **Component Functionality**
- ✅ **Drawer components** work correctly
- ✅ **Mobile responsiveness** maintained
- ✅ **Accessibility features** preserved
- ✅ **Animation performance** unchanged

### 📊 **Build Results**
