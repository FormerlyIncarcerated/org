## 2. Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

#### 2.1 Systemic Barriers
Formerly incarcerated individuals face numerous systemic barriers to reintegration:
- **Employment discrimination** based on criminal history
- **Limited access to capital** for entrepreneurship
- **Housing instability** due to background check requirements
- **Social stigma** affecting community integration
- **Lack of representation** in policy-making processes

#### 2.2 Existing Solution Limitations
Current reentry programs suffer from:
- **Centralized control** limiting community input
- **Lack of transparency** in resource allocation
- **One-size-fits-all approaches** ignoring individual needs
- **Limited scalability** due to funding constraints
- **Insufficient long-term support** systems

#### 2.3 Economic Impact
The current system creates significant economic inefficiencies:
- **$80 billion annual cost** of incarceration in the US
- **68% recidivism rate** within three years of release
- **$400 billion in lost economic output** annually
- **Limited tax revenue** from underemployed populations

### The Opportunity
Web3 technology offers unprecedented opportunities to address these challenges through:
- **Decentralized governance** enabling community control
