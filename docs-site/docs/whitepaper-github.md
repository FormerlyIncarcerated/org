## Abstract

FormerlyIncarcerated.org represents a paradigm shift in reentry support systems, leveraging Web3 technology to create dignified, community-driven pathways to opportunity for formerly incarcerated individuals. This whitepaper outlines our vision for a decentralized platform that addresses systemic barriers through innovative blockchain solutions, community governance, and economic empowerment.

Our platform combines decentralized identity management, community-driven funding mechanisms, and transparent governance to create sustainable pathways to employment, entrepreneurship, and social reintegration. By placing formerly incarcerated individuals at the center of decision-making processes, we ensure that solutions are designed by and for the community they serve.
