# Architecture

This document outlines the architectural decisions and patterns used in the FUSED GAMING React TypeScript Boilerplate.

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies

- **React 18** - Latest React with concurrent features and improved performance
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and enhanced developer experience
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling

### UI & Animation

- **Framer Motion** - Production-ready motion library for smooth animations
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful and consistent icon toolkit
- **clsx** - Utility for constructing className strings conditionally

### Routing & Forms

- **React Router v6** - Declarative routing for React applications
- **React Hook Form** - Performant forms with easy validation
- **Zod** - TypeScript-first schema validation

### Testing & Quality

- **Vitest** - Fast unit test framework powered by Vite
- **React Testing Library** - Testing utilities for React components
- **ESLint** - Code linting and quality enforcement
- **Prettier** - Code formatting and style consistency

## Design Patterns

### Component Architecture

```
components/
├── ui/              # Atomic UI components
├── navigation/      # Navigation-specific components
├── forms/          # Form-related components
└── layout/         # Layout and structure components
```

#### Atomic Design Principles

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (Button, Input, Card)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms (SearchBox, FormField)
- **Organisms**: Complex UI components (Header, Footer, Navigation)
- **Templates**: Page-level layouts
- **Pages**: Specific instances of templates

### State Management

#### Context Pattern
- **ThemeContext**: Global theme state management
- Lightweight state management for UI preferences
- Avoids prop drilling for commonly used state

#### Local State
- Component-specific state using `useState`
- Form state managed by React Hook Form
- Custom hooks for reusable stateful logic

### Type Safety

#### TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled for maximum type safety
- Path mapping configured for clean imports (`@/`)
- Comprehensive type definitions for all components

#### Interface Design
```typescript
export interface ComponentProps {
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  children: React.ReactNode;
  className?: string;
}
```

### Styling Architecture

#### Theme System
- CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- 5 pre-built themes with consistent color schemes
- Dark mode optimized with proper contrast ratios

#### Utility-First Approach
- Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- Custom utility classes for theme-specific styles
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

#### Component Styling
```typescript
const buttonVariants = {
  primary: 'bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90',
  secondary: 'bg-secondary text-secondary-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80',
};
```

## File Organization

### Import Strategy
```typescript
// External libraries
import React from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

// Internal utilities
import { clsx } from 'clsx';

// Local components
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';
```

### Barrel Exports
- Index files for clean imports
- Organized exports by feature area
- Simplified import statements

### Asset Management
- Static assets in `public/` directory
- Component-specific assets co-located
- Optimized images and icons

## Performance Considerations

### Build Optimization
- Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- Tree shaking for minimal bundle size

### Runtime Performance
- React 18 concurrent features
- Memoization where appropriate
- Efficient re-rendering patterns

### Loading Strategies
- Lazy loading for route components
- Progressive enhancement
- Optimistic UI updates

## Security

### Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Runtime validation with Zod
- Proper error boundaries

### Best Practices
- Input sanitization
- XSS prevention
- Secure routing patterns

## Scalability

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Modular component design
- Reusable utility functions

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for user flows
- Coverage reporting

### Documentation
- Comprehensive component documentation
- Type definitions serve as documentation
- Example usage patterns

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality
- ESLint for code quality
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Pre-commit hooks (recommended)

### Testing
- Test-driven development encouraged
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Coverage thresholds for quality assurance

### Build Process
- TypeScript compilation
- Vite bundling and optimization
- Asset optimization and compression
